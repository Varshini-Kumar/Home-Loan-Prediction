Developed a predictive model for home loan approvals using the "Loan Prediction Data" dataset from Kaggle. Utilized Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand and visualize data patterns.

◾Addressed missing values and performed data preprocessing.
◾Employed feature engineering to enhance model performance.
◾Built and trained a Decision Tree Classifier.
◾Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
◾Visualized feature importances to interpret model decisions.

Achieved a robust and interpretable model for predicting loan approvals, enhancing skills in data analysis, machine learning, and model evaluation
